# AddressBook

This is an AngularJS address book demo which was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2. This project is created as an answer to an question. And here are the details:

Itâ€™s highly preferable to use Angular/AngularJS with as less of other frameworks/libraries as possible. Yet, in case you have no Angular/ AngularJS experience, you can use other frameworks too.

## Requirements:

1. Cell phone column can be edited when double clicked.
2. Clicking the column label would sort the column alphabetically.
3. When the selector of the first column and the first row is checked, all rows are selected.
4. Clicking the Delete button will delete the selected rows.
5. Update will cause the Ajax invocation to update the modified rows. For now, just pop up a alert showing the rows you are to update.
6. Add will add an empty row to fill in the data except the ID, which will be filled after updating.
7. Think of how to localize this.

## Also, please answer the following questions for the project:

### Explain how to structure an UI project in MVC model with a simple example.


### Explain how AngularJS directive is used, and give a couple of use cases.


### Explain how AngularJS scope is defined, and give a couple of use cases.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
